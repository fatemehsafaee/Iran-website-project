    <a href="https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85" target="_blank"><mark>Khayam Nishaburi </mark></a> is considered one of the greatest Iranian scientists and philosophers whose quatrains were a guarantee for his lofty philosophical and scientific position; As far as the fame of Khayyam's poetry, today it has increased from his achievements in the field of material philosophy, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy and chronology.

        Hakim Omar Khayyam can be considered as one of the most influential scientific and literary personalities of Iran, whose amazing words and thoughts, after many years, enchant the minds of Persian speakers and bring light to the people of the pen and science.
   <br><br>
   Khayyam Nishaburi was born in the city of Nishabour in the fifth century AH. His full name was "Ghias al-Din Abul Fatah Umar bin Ibrahim Khayyam Neishaburi". He is also called Khayami, Khayyam Nishaburi and Khayami Al-Nyshaburi. He was born at a time when the Seljuk Turks dominated Great Khorasan.</p>

    He studied science in his hometown and learned the sciences of his time from prominent scholars and professors of that city, including "Imam Mawafaq Nishaburi", and as they have said, he was very young when he mastered philosophy and mathematics. In 461 AH, Khayyam left Neyshabur for Samarkand, and there, under the patronage and supervision of "Abu Tahir Ghazi-al-Qadat" of Samarkand, he wrote a book about equations of the third degree under the name Risalah fi al-Barahin Ali al-Jabr and Al-Maqbala in Arabic language, and since with Khawaja Nizam al-Molk Tusi had a good relationship, he presented this book to Khawaja after writing it.

He studied jurisprudence in his middle age in the presence of Imam Mowafq Nishaburi; He learned Hadith, Tafsir, Philosophy, Wisdom and Astrology. Some have written that he learned philosophy directly from the Greek language
<br>After this period, Khayyam went to Isfahan at the invitation of Sultan Jalaluddin Malik Shah Seljuqi and his minister Nizam al-Molk to take charge of one of the oldest observatories in Iran, the Isfahan Observatory. One of his most prominent works can be considered the reform of Iran's chronology. He lived there for 18 years. In these same years (456), he wrote his most important and influential mathematical work called "Treatise on our explanation of Euclid's collections" in which he describes parallel lines and the theory of ratios. Zij Malekshahi is prepared under his management and he adjusts the calendar reform plan in the same years (around 458). Khayyam compiled the Jalali calendar or the Jalali calendar, which is known as Jalal al-Din Malik Shah; But after the death of Malek Shah, this chronology did not continue. During this period, Khayyam served as an astrologer in the court, although he did not believe in astrology.
<br><br> Due to the riots and conflicts caused by this, the scientific and cultural issues that were of special importance before were forgotten. After the death of Malik Shah and the death of Nizam al-Molk, Khayyam was neglected and financial aid to the observatory (Zeij) was cut off. The lack of attention to the scientific affairs of scientists and the observatory made Khayyam leave Isfahan for Khorasan. After 479, Khayyam left Isfahan to settle in Merv, the new capital of the Seljuqs.

He spent the rest of his life in the important cities of Khorasan, especially Neishabur and Merv. At that time, Merv was considered one of the most important scientific and cultural centers in the world, and many scientists were present there. Most of Khayyam's scientific works took place in this city after returning from Isfahan. He probably wrote the treatises Mizan al-Hakm and Qastas al-Mustaqim there. The treatise on math problems (problems in arithmetic) was probably written in these years.

Khayyam's death is considered to be between 517-520 AH, which happened in Neishabur. Her tomb is now located in the city of Neishabur, in the garden of Imamzadeh Mahrouq tomb.

<h4>Achievements of Khayyam Nishaburi</h4>
<h5>Mathematics</h5>
<p>
    Khayyam's footprints can be followed in the development of mathematics in Europe. George Sarton calls Khayyam one of the greatest mathematicians of the Middle Ages.

<h5>Astrology</h5>
<p>
    Omar Khayyam was one of the pioneers of his time in the study of stars and constellations, and the fruit of his activity in this field can be summarized in his effort to reform the chronology of Iran during the reign of Malik Shah Seljuq. By calculating the orbit of the earth around the sun to 16 decimal places, Khayyam revised the Jalali calendar on 25 Farvardin 458 Hijri.
</p>
<h5>Music</h5>
<p>
    Khayyam has also studied the mathematical analysis of music
</p>
<h5>the literature</h5>
<p>
    Khayyam lived his life as a famous mathematician and philosopher, while his contemporaries were unaware of the quatrains that are the source of his fame and pride today. Khayyam's contemporaries such as Nizami Prozodi did not mention Khayyam's poetry. The oldest book in which Khayyam the poet is mentioned is the book "Khoridat al-Qasr" by Emad al-Din Isfahani. This book was written in Arabic nearly 50 years after Khayyam's death
    Some Persian scholars believe that Khayyam's quatrains are a whip against hypocritical ascetics. In his poems, Khayyam portrays the invalidity of the world and the instability of the temporary human existence in life. Khayyam's harsh language in quatrains is a whip on false and hypocritical ascetics. Some have introduced him as a wise and mystical poet, while others have introduced him as a poet who does not believe in everything and is purely materialistic. Najmuddin Razi and two or three other people have negative comments about Khayyam due to the atheistic content of Rabaiyat Khayyam.

    On the other hand, others tried to exonerate him and made quatrains from his words to show his regret and repentance. Some people, mostly in the contemporary period, tried to say that these quatrains are not from Khayyam at all and are from someone else with the same name.

    <p>
        In literature and poetry, Khayyam Nishaburi has gained the most fame in his quatrains. Among the great poets of Iran, there are few people as famous as Khayyam. The peak of the world's knowledge of Khayyam can be seen after the translation of his poems by Edward Fitzgerald, and his name was placed among the four great poets of the world, namely Homer, Shakespeare, Dante and Goethe. Khayyam's influence on Western literature, from Mark Twain to TS Eliot, has made him a symbol of Eastern philosophy and a popular poet among world intellectuals.
        <br>
        After Fitzgerald, the French helped introduce Khayyam in the western world by translating his quatrains. In 1875, the famous French Orientalist Garsen Dutasi took 10 quatrains of Khayyam to France, while about ten years earlier, in 1867, Nicolas, the consul of the French Embassy in Rasht, presented the first translation of the quatrains to France. . Andre Gide was also familiar with Khayyam's quatrains through Fitzgerald's translation, and the reflection of some of the concepts of Khayyam's quatrains can be seen in his book "Earthly Materials". Vladimir Putin, Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln always recited Khayyam's quatrains before going to sleep.

    <h4>Thoughts of Khayyam Nishabouri</h4>

    Khayyam Neishabouri's undeniable and eloquent influence on Eastern philosophy and his numerous treatises and books on logic and philosophy, as well as his eternal art in the quatrain that contains the essence of all his thoughts and knowledge in a mysterious way, commentators and enthusiasts It has made many to know him
    Before looking carefully at Khayyam's writing and mysterious art, it should be noted that Hakim Nishaburi was one of the most respected people of his time in Islamic jurisprudence and sciences, and therefore, his poems and thoughts do not indicate ignorance and ignorance. Khayyam's poems with a rich content make man and his concerns a toy and express concern for the future of mankind. Hakim Nishaburi, walking in the stars and the heavens, calls man an unaffected being in existence and removes the illusion of nobility over creatures from his mind.
    Doubt is the basis of Khayyam's philosophy and he criticizes topics such as creation, creation, the world after death and religion. Khayyam Nishabouri reminds people of death and emphasizes on taking advantage of life; A life that, in his opinion, is the only human possession, and the king and the beggar will not escape from the endless emptiness after that.
    <br>
    <p align="center">
    <br>از آمدنم نبود گردون را سود
    <br>وز رفتن من جاه و جلالش نفزود

    <br>وز هیچ‌کسی نیز دو گوشم نشنود
    <br>!کاین آمدن و رفتنم از بهر چه بود
</p>
    <br>
    Khayyam Neishabouri is a person who disturbs the equations of the world with his philosophy. "Alas" is a special part of Khayyam's Tariqat; Because he believes that after death, everything will be lost and human effort will be in vain. It is as if he had come to remind him of the wandering of man and to give him a legacy of doubt; A legacy that will not be destroyed by the confiscation of various currents, schools, religions and thoughts. Perhaps the foundation of Jahan Khayyam's world can be summarized in this stanza of his that he sings: "You search a lot and you don't find anymore/بسیار بجویی و نیابی دیگر"
