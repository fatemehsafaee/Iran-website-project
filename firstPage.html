            <p>
                Iran spans an expansive territory of approximately 1,648,195 square kilometers, making it the 18th largest country in the world. It is situated between the Caspian Sea to the north and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south. The country is characterized by a diverse topography shaped by its mountain ranges, deserts, and plains.
                The Alborz Mountains extend along the northern border, with the majestic Mount Damavand standing as the highest peak in Iran and the highest volcano in Asia. The Zagros Mountains traverse the western and southwestern parts of the country, featuring rugged peaks, deep valleys, and scenic plateaus.
                Iran's central regions are dominated by two expansive deserts. The Dasht-e Kavir, also known as the Great Salt Desert, covers much of the central plateau, while the Dasht-e Lut, recognized as one of the hottest places on Earth, stretches across the southeast.
                The country's fertile plains, such as the Khuzestan Plain and the Caspian Sea coastal plain, support agricultural activities. Additionally, Iran benefits from several rivers, including the Karun, Dez, and Kharkeh, which provide water resources for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Iran has a rich and captivating history that spans millennia. The region has been inhabited since ancient times and witnessed the rise and fall of numerous civilizations. One of the earliest known civilizations in Iran was the Elamite civilization, which thrived in the southwestern part of the country around 2700 BCE.
                In the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenid Empire, founded by Cyrus the Great, emerged and became one of the most influential empires in history. It encompassed a vast territory, stretching from Egypt to India. Under the Achaemenids, Iran experienced significant cultural and architectural developments, including the construction of magnificent structures such as Persepolis.
            </p>
            <details>
                Over the centuries, Iran saw the rise and fall of other great empires, such as the Parthians, Sassanids, and Safavids. These empires left their mark on Iranian culture, religion, and governance, contributing to the rich tapestry of Iranian identity.
                    In the 7th century CE, Islam arrived in Iran, leading to the Arab conquest and the spread of Islam throughout the region. Despite Arab rule, Iran managed to retain its distinct Persian language, literature, and cultural traditions.Iran experienced a renaissance during the Islamic Golden Age, from the 8th to the 13th centuries, marked by advancements in science, philosophy, art, and literature. Poets like Rumi and Omar Khayyam, and scholars like Avicenna and Al-Biruni, contributed greatly to the intellectual and cultural achievements of the era.
                    In more recent history, Iran underwent significant transformations, including the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911, which led to the establishment of the first parliament and the introduction of modern reforms. 
                    <br><br>
                    The 20th century witnessed political upheavals, including the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which resulted in the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
                    Today, Iran stands as a proud nation with a deep respect for its history and heritage. It continues to navigate its role in the global community, balancing ancient traditions with modern aspirations.
